# small_projects
Overview

This repository contains Python scripts I’ve developed for learning, experimentation, and practical projects. Some scripts are work-in-progress (WIP) and are not fully finished or optimized, while others are more complete.

The main goal is to demonstrate my skills in Python, HTTP requests, API interaction, and small automation tools.
